# EntraIDLicenseIdToProductName
Designed to help easily find the product name associated with a specific GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) used in Microsoft licensing.
The script retrieves and processes a lookup table from an online source, allowing you to search for product details using a GUID. 

The complete product names and service plan identifiers for licensing in Entra ID and Office 365 is found here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/licensing-service-plan-reference

In short, the HTML-table is retrived from the above website, then parsed into a PowerShell-Object, and saved to disk as a CSV-file for next lookup.
If the CSV already exsists, it will do the lookup directly vs. the local file.

# Example 1 - Lookup a single GUID/SkuID
```PowerShell
.\LicenseIdToProductName.ps1 -GUID '06ebc4ee-1bb5-47dd-8120-11324bc54e06'
```

# Example 2 - Display the complete table
```PowerShell
.\LicenseIdToProductName.ps1 -ShowCompleteTable
```
